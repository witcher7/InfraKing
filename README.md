## What Is This?

A no-cap backend infrastructure playground where Go, TypeScript, and Python vibe together to build scalable microservices. This repo is where DevOps meets actual enjoyable code. Think of it as your one-stop shop for backend architecture that doesn't make you want to rage quit.

## The Stack (It's Giving Main Character Energy)

- **Go** - The fast, concurrent king. No cap, it slaps for backend services
- **TypeScript** - Type safety is self-care, bestie
- **Python** - The glue that holds chaos together (data pipelines, automation, you know)
- **Docker & Kubernetes** - Containerization that goes hard
- **Microservices Architecture** - Because monoliths are so 2019
- **DevOps Pipelines** - CI/CD that actually works without manifesting bad vibes
