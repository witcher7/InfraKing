# Infra King 🏰👑

Welcome to the kingdom where infra is the new swag. If you're looking for a backend that’s cooler than a iced coffee in Delhi summer, you’ve come to the right place. This repo is a chaotic mix of Go, TypeScript, Python, and DevOps magic—all wrapped up in microservices that scale faster than your last-minute assignment.  

---

## 🔥 What's in the Box?

- **Go**: For when you want your backend to be as fast as your morning chai run.
- **TypeScript**: Because JavaScript is cool, but TypeScript is *extra* cool.
- **Python**: For data wizardry, scripts, and the occasional meme automation.
- **DevOps**: CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform—you name it, we break it, then fix it.

When your infra is so solid, even AWS gives you a side-eye of respect.

## 🧩 Microservices? More Like Micro-slay

Each service does its own thing, but together they’re like a Bollywood dance crew—chaotic, but somehow it works.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Go**: Fast, efficient, and perfect for building APIs that don’t crash when traffic spikes.
- **TypeScript**: For frontend/backend harmony, because JavaScript without types is like Delhi traffic without traffic signals.
- **Python**: For scripts, data, and the occasional meme generator.
- **DevOps Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Terraform—because manual deployments are so 2010.

## 🧙‍♂️ How to Use

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run the setup script (it’s magic, trust me).
3. Deploy, break, fix, repeat.

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Add more microservices (because why stop at one?).
- Automate everything (even the coffee machine).
- Make infra so smooth, even your non-tech friends will be impressed.
